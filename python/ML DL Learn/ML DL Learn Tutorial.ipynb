    "#### Perceptron\n",
    "- Takes several 'binary' inputs to produce a 'binary' output by comparing the weighted sum of inputs against a threshold, \n",
    "- The threshold is treated as bias and moved to left side of equation to compare weighted sum against zero\n",
    "- If a small change in a weight or bias causes only a small change in output, it is possible for a network to learn. \n",
    "- But, this doesn't happen with perceptrons sometimes as **small change in weights can entirely flip the output** from say 1 to 0"

    "- Sigmoid neurons are similar to perceptrons (shape is a smoothed out version of a step function), <br> but modified so that **small changes in their weights and bias cause only a small change in their output**\n",
    "- instead of being just 0 or 1, these inputs can also take on any values between 0 and 1\n",
    "- output is not 0 or 1. Instead, it's σ(w⋅x+b), where σ is called the sigmoid function\n",
    "- Somewhat confusingly, and for historical reasons, such multiple layer networks are sometimes called multilayer perceptrons or MLPs, despite being made up of sigmoid neurons, not perceptrons. "
